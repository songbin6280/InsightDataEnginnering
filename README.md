Insight Data Engineering Word Count Code

-----------------------------------------------------------------

- To achieve the first task, I used C++ and Standard Library Template
Map to order words. 

- To achieve the second task, I used Python and numpy package to compute
the median.

- I aslo included a MD simulation (NVT, Nose-Hoover chain thermostat) code in python to furthur demonstrate my coding experience.
